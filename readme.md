The end goal of this project is to create an online platform for playing mahjong. The technologies used will definitely include JavaScript and React and will likely include Node and Firebase. I intend to develop the technology in the following phases:

## Checkpoints
1. A simple application that allows the player to draw and discard mahjong tiles. The player should be able to

1. The application should be able to recognize winning hands, hands that are one tile from winning, and furiten. I may include the ability to directly modify the hand for educational purposes.

1. The application should be modified to include online play. At this point there is no need for database management.

1. User profiles can be created and success rates can be logged.

1. Finally, I would like to develop a 'class' for teaching players how to play the game. This would involve lessons over important game rules and strategies, and would be a highly directed experience. This may also involve the development of AI that can play the game at least competently.
